                                <p class="lede"><strong>Many business owners feel stressed and sapped by the relentless demands of running their business</strong>. Oftentimes, this is because their business is structured in a way that makes it completely dependent on the owner’s constant involvement.</p>

                                <p>If this sounds like you, you’ll recognise the related problems that come with this. The difficulty in switching off. The feeling of never having enough free time for yourself. And of not being able to recharge because taking decent holidays on a regular basis seems like a pipe dream.</p>

                                <div class="more">

		                                <p>The underlying cause in most cases is that the business fails to have adequate systems in place. This means that the knowledge of how to do things is inside the business owner’s head, or known primarily by other key personnel. This is very risky – as all it takes for the business to falter is for that person to be absent, or worse – in the case of an employee – exit the business altogether.</p>

		                                <p>With Business Blueprint, you’ll discover an abundance of ready-made, simple systems you can implement quickly. Each will help you boost efficiency in your business, and create a greater consistency in the quality of how you do things. Even better, these systems will instantly loosen the stranglehold your business has on you personally, creating more time and freedom for you.</p>

		                                <p>And please note, our approach has nothing to do with old school policies and procedures manuals. The systems you’ll learn about use the latest online tools and technologies to make it fast and easy to embed highly productive systems in your business.</p>

                                <p class="lede">If you want to be a successful entrepreneur, the one thing you absolutely must master is how well you use your time.</p>

                                <p>Productive-PeopleTime is the only commodity you can’t stretch or grow. You have the same 24 hours in the day as everyone else, but it’s how you use those hours that will determine how successful you ultimately become in your business.</p>

	                                <p>It’s also vitally important that everyone who’s part of your team understands – and buys into – your vision for your business.</p>

	                                <p>When everyone focuses on the same goals and ideals, and uses their time as productively as possible, you have the foundation for an amazing business.</p>

	                                <p>Your business exists in the global economy. Today more than ever, you can tap into the time and talents of people from all over the world – at a fraction of the cost of a local hire.</p>
